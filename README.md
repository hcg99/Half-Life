These programs give a visual simulation of isotope decay. Each isotope particle is represented by a coloured circle and has a pre-defined probability of decaying - represented by the circle changing colour.

  Isotopes decay once into a stable isotope.

  Isotopes decay twice, once into an unstable isotpe which will then decay into a stable isotope.
